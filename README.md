# GraverController
An ATMEGA328P based Mosfet controller for solenoid.
I got into jewelry making in 2010 to pay for my college expenses. After graduating as a mechanical engineer I realized part of my knowledge should not be wasted and should be applied into something I like.
After looking into the options on a pneumatic graver I realized it was either too expensive or bulky. 
I would not have space for a compressor because I lived in a small room on a fraternity.
This is, then, my approach to a solenoid based graver machine.
You could check other approaches like https://github.com/alastair-duncan/SuperEZGraver and also the https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE2rGFm1-xs-WIEHfY1enjA.
The focus I want to bring is of a solenoid for stone setting and fine work.

If you are handy in terms of Arduino coding and making breadboard circuits this will be super easy to make and program this will cover mainly a way to make the controller. There will be a way to make a handpiece but still not a fine tuned one.
