The first solenoid I tested was the smallest 5v solenoid i could get just to prove the concept. (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2776)
It was really weak and I realized that I was supposed to know about how a graver would work.
I found some options to understand better the impact force on this video from Shaun Hughes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zzqaAYdvdQ&ab_channel=ShaunHughesEngraving) and from that went on the look for a solenoid that would give me the aproximate ammount of travel for this to happen.

The first solenoid I went to was a popular jf-0530B (12V, 300mA) that had quite a punch but a long stroke and long body, making the handpice too bulky. Maybe to replace a hammer and chisel for someone with a disabilyty might be awesome. (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32777233179.html)

The second solenoid used was the one from adafruit, a little wider. It had strong strokes but a lower frequency of oscilation. (https://www.adafruit.com/product/413)

I had an intermediary that was open and could dissipate better the heat while having a good impact force.

unfortunatelly this also had a low frequency and to make it
