To start the desig of thehandpiece I took into consideration the design of current pneumatic gravers. To keep standard dimensions went first on some commercial models, [technical drawings](https://www.chipmaker.ru/topic/132834/?page=4) and details I found on some [forums](https://www.jportal.ru/forum/forum76/topic15895/).
I will skip here the previous considerations of the handpiece from the solenoid choice on the other folder of this project, therefore I will only cite here the design based on the last solenoid.

1 - The easiest collet to use.
2 - The strength of the connection from the 3D printed version to the piston tube.
3 - Heat dissipation.
4 - Possibility of control the stroke lenght on a free piston solenoid.

1 - The easiest collet to use that was [available](https://www.cooksongold.com/Jewellery-Tools/GRS-Quick-Change-Traditional-Tool-Holder-For-3.45mm-Shank-Gravers----Pack-of-3-prcode-998-G231?p=gs&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_dWGBhDAARIsAMcYuJwNWsv_Is8lBIyuRlEqWVqBMedcsNCCBHIHIZiNWDvLjcYUt8GRA2YaAn9vEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) was the GRS collet that had 6.35mm diameter or 1/4 inch. (I don't like these imperial measurements I would rather have a collet with a round mm number that would make it easier to adapt something) I had it available on my country since it's a global and present company.

2 - To resolve the strengh of the connection on the plastic of the 3D printed handpiece, avoiding it breaking because of the constant impact and rubbing on the plastic, I found online a [hobbist brass tube](https://www.hobbylinc.com/k-s-round-brass-tube-9:32-hobby-and-craft-metal-tubing-8132) with the correct internal diameter matching the external diameter of the collet. This way I would insert the brass tube inside the 3D printed handpiece to hold the collet and make a smoother movement while also strenghtening the handpiece on the most critical place.

3 - Heat dissipation would be done by having openings on the faces that had the least ammount of stress. Since the PLA used would retain the heat it would not be good to have it carry the heat away. For now the heat will go to all he sides instead of a channeled air path.
