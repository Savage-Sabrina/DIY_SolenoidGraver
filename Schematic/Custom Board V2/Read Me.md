This version of the board is the final developed for the Arduino Nano.
I realized that not everyone had the knowledge to burn a bootloader on the MCU so the arduino Nano option was the best option.
The board can handle the 18V 1.5A on the power traces.
The code is on the Arduino Code folder in a way that is shown on the youtube video.
